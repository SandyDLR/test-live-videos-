00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,150
At least once a year, I like to

2
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:05,290
bring in some of my Kevin's Famous Chili.

3
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:09,450
The trick is to undercook the onions.

4
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:12,270
Everybody is going to get to know each

5
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:13,410
other in the pot.

6
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:16,130
I'm serious about this stuff.

7
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:19,870
I'm up the night before pressing garlic and

8
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:21,350
dicing whole tomatoes.

9
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,750
I toast my own ancho chilies.

10
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:30,610
It's a recipe passed down from Malone's for

11
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:31,310
generations.

12
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:35,050
It's probably the thing I do best.
